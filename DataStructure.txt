Data Structure Advantages

Data Structure can be defined as the collection of data objects which provides a way of storing and managing data in the computer so that it can be used. Various Data Structures types are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science for simple as well as complex computations. Data structures are used in all areas of computer science such as Artificial Intelligence, graphics, Operating system etc.


Efficient Memory use: With efficient use of data structure memory usage can be optimized, for e.g we can use linked list vs arrays when we are not sure about the size of data. When there is no more use of memory, it can be released.

Data Structures are the key part of many computer algorithms as they allow the programmers to do data management in an efficient way. A right selection of data structure can enhance the efficiency of computer program or algorithm in a better way.
